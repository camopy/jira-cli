# :package: Install

jira-cli ships as a single static Go binary. Pick a method below; each tab is
self-contained. Working on jira itself? See
[Contributing](https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) instead.

## Install methods

=== "Homebrew"

    Recommended on macOS (Apple Silicon) and Linux (amd64/arm64).

    ```sh
    brew tap matcra587/tap
    brew install matcra587/tap/jira
    ```

    The formula lives in
    [`matcra587/homebrew-tap`](https://github.com/matcra587/homebrew-tap)
    and tracks the latest GitHub release.

    ??? tip "No Homebrew?"
        Use the one-line installer:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://matcra587.github.io/jira-cli/install.sh | sh
        ```

    ??? note "Intel macOS / build from source"
        No `darwin/amd64` bottle is published. `brew install --HEAD
        matcra587/tap/jira` compiles the latest `main` with the Go toolchain
        and embeds version metadata. It's the one Homebrew path that works on
        Intel macOS.

=== "Scoop"

    Recommended on Windows (amd64/arm64). Add the bucket once, then install:

    ```powershell
    scoop bucket add matcra587 https://github.com/matcra587/scoop-bucket
    scoop install matcra587/jira
    ```

    The manifest lives in
    [`matcra587/scoop-bucket`](https://github.com/matcra587/scoop-bucket)
    and tracks the latest GitHub release.

=== "mise"

    Works anywhere [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) runs. It downloads the release
    binary from GitHub Releases:

    ```sh
    mise use -g github:matcra587/jira-cli@latest
    ```

    List versions with `mise ls-remote github:matcra587/jira-cli`. mise pulls the
    release archives, so there's no Intel-macOS build; for checksum and signature
    verification, use the **Pre-built binaries** tab.

=== "One-line installer"

    For Linux (amd64/arm64) and Apple Silicon macOS. A POSIX-sh installer
    auto-detects OS and architecture, resolves the release tag, verifies the
    SHA-256 against the published `checksums.txt` (and the cosign signature when
    `cosign` is on `PATH`), and installs into `$HOME/.local/bin`.

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://matcra587.github.io/jira-cli/install.sh | sh
    ```

    Pin a version with the tag: `… | sh -s v0.5.9`. Native Windows isn't covered
    (the installer is POSIX-sh). Use the **Scoop** or **mise** tab, or run it
    under [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/).

    ??? info "Environment overrides"
        The positional version argument is the common case; everything else is
        controlled by environment variables.

        | Variable | Effect |
        |---|---|
        | `JIRA_CLI_VERSION` | Pin a release tag (same effect as the positional argument; the positional argument wins when both are set). |
        | `JIRA_CLI_INSTALL_DIR` | Install directory. Default: `$HOME/.local/bin`. Use `/usr/local/bin` for a system-wide install. |
        | `JIRA_CLI_NO_VERIFY` | Set to `1` to skip cosign verification when cosign is unavailable. SHA-256 still runs. |

        Example, system-wide install:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://matcra587.github.io/jira-cli/install.sh | JIRA_CLI_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
        ```

    ??? warning "What `curl | sh` actually runs"
        The installer's source lives at [`docs/install.sh`](https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/blob/main/docs/install.sh), about 130 lines of POSIX sh. Inspect it before piping into `sh` if you don't already trust the source:

        ```sh
        curl -fsSL https://matcra587.github.io/jira-cli/install.sh | less
        ```

=== "go install"

    Any Go platform supported by jira's dependencies, including Intel macOS.

    ```sh
    go install github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/cmd/jira@latest
    ```

    Installs the latest tagged release into `$(go env GOBIN)` (or
    `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`).

    ??? warning "Version metadata"
        This path embeds limited version metadata: `jira version` reports `dev`
        or git-derived values because the version package relies on compile-time
        `-X` ldflag overrides that `go install` does not supply. For accurate
        `jira version` output, use Homebrew, mise, or the pre-built binaries.

=== "Pre-built binaries"

    GitHub Releases ship checksummed archives for Linux (amd64/arm64) and macOS
    arm64 as `.tar.gz`, and Windows (amd64/arm64) as `.zip`. Reach for these for
    a scripted pipeline, a stricter audit trail, or to avoid piping `curl` into
    `sh`.

    The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) resolves the latest release and
    fetches the archive plus checksums (Linux amd64 shown):

    ```sh
    gh release download --repo matcra587/jira-cli \
        --pattern 'jira_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz' \
        --pattern 'checksums.txt'
    sha256sum -c checksums.txt --ignore-missing
    tar xzf jira_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    sudo install jira /usr/local/bin/
    ```

    Swap the arch and OS in `--pattern` for your platform (Windows ships a
    `.zip`). To check the signature too, add `--pattern
    'checksums.txt.sigstore.json'` and follow the **Cosign signature
    verification** note.

    ??? note "Without the GitHub CLI (curl + SHA-256)"

        The archives follow `jira_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` (Windows uses
        `.zip`). Resolve the latest tag, download, and verify by hand:

        === "bash · zsh"

            ```bash
            VERSION=$(curl -fsSLI -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}' \
                https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/latest | sed 's#.*/tag/##')
            OS=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
            ARCH=$(uname -m | sed 's/x86_64/amd64/;s/aarch64/arm64/')

            curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/download/${VERSION}/jira_${VERSION#v}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"
            curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/download/${VERSION}/checksums.txt"
            grep "_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz$" checksums.txt | sha256sum -c

            tar xzf "jira_${VERSION#v}_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz"
            sudo install jira /usr/local/bin/
            ```

        === "fish"

            ```fish
            set VERSION (curl -fsSLI -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}' \
                https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/latest | string replace -r '.*/tag/' '')
            set OS (uname -s | string lower)
            set ARCH (uname -m | string replace x86_64 amd64 | string replace aarch64 arm64)
            set NUM (string replace -r '^v' '' $VERSION)
            set TARBALL (printf 'jira_%s_%s_%s.tar.gz' $NUM $OS $ARCH)

            curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/download/$VERSION/$TARBALL"
            curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/download/$VERSION/checksums.txt"
            grep (printf '_%s_%s.tar.gz$' $OS $ARCH) checksums.txt | sha256sum -c

            tar xzf $TARBALL
            sudo install jira /usr/local/bin/
            ```

    ??? note "Cosign signature verification"

        `checksums.txt` is signed with [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign)
        keyless signing; a `checksums.txt.sigstore.json` bundle ships next to the
        release artifacts. The one-line installer verifies it automatically when
        `cosign` is on `PATH`. To verify by hand:

        === "bash · zsh"

            ```bash
            curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/download/${VERSION}/checksums.txt.sigstore.json"
            cosign verify-blob \
                --bundle checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
                --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/" \
                --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
                checksums.txt
            ```

        === "fish"

            ```fish
            curl -fsSLO "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/releases/download/$VERSION/checksums.txt.sigstore.json"
            cosign verify-blob \
                --bundle checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
                --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/" \
                --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
                checksums.txt
            ```

        The archives themselves are not individually signed; the checksum bundle
        covers them transitively.

## Verify the install

```sh
jira version
```

Prints the installed version, commit, branch, build time, and `built by` (one of
`goreleaser`, `homebrew`, or the local user for a dev build).

If `jira: command not found`, the binary isn't on `PATH`. Homebrew and mise
handle this for you; the one-line installer prints a PATH-fix hint; for
`go install` make sure `$(go env GOBIN)` (or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) is on your
`PATH`.

## Update jira

=== "Homebrew"

    ```sh
    brew upgrade jira
    ```

=== "Scoop"

    ```powershell
    scoop update jira
    ```

=== "mise"

    ```sh
    mise up github:matcra587/jira-cli
    ```

=== "One-line installer"

    Re-run the installer command:

    ```sh
    curl -fsSL https://matcra587.github.io/jira-cli/install.sh | sh
    ```

=== "go install"

    ```sh
    go install github.com/matcra587/jira-cli/cmd/jira@latest
    ```

=== "Pre-built binaries"

    Re-download the latest archive with `--clobber` to overwrite the existing
    files (Linux amd64 shown), then reinstall over the binary on your `PATH`:

    ```sh
    gh release download --repo matcra587/jira-cli --clobber \
        --pattern 'jira_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz'
    tar xzf jira_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    sudo install jira /usr/local/bin/
    ```

## Uninstall jira

Removing the binary doesn't drop stored credentials or your local config. Clean
those up explicitly if you're walking away from jira entirely.

=== "Homebrew"

    ```sh
    brew uninstall jira
    ```

=== "Scoop"

    ```powershell
    scoop uninstall matcra587/jira
    ```

=== "mise"

    ```sh
    mise uninstall github:matcra587/jira-cli
    mise use -g --remove github:matcra587/jira-cli
    ```

=== "One-line installer"

    ```sh
    rm -f "$HOME/.local/bin/jira"  # (1)!
    ```

    1.  Installed to a custom `JIRA_CLI_INSTALL_DIR`? Remove it there instead,
        e.g. `sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/jira`.

=== "go install"

    ```sh
    rm -f "$(go env GOBIN)/jira" 2>/dev/null \
      || rm -f "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/jira"
    ```

=== "Pre-built binaries"

    ```sh
    sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/jira  # (1)!
    ```

    1.  Installed somewhere other than `/usr/local/bin`? Remove it from there
        instead, e.g. `rm -f "$HOME/.local/bin/jira"`.

??? warning "Credentials and config are not removed"
    The binary uninstall leaves your stored API tokens in the OS keyring (or
    1Password vault) and your config TOML on disk. To remove them:

    ```sh
    jira auth logout <profile>  # (1)!
    rm -rf "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/jira-cli"  # (2)!
    rm -rf "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/jira-cli"  # (3)!
    ```

    1.  Drop the stored credential for every profile, one at a time.
    2.  Remove the config file.
    3.  Remove the local cache.

    On Windows the equivalent dirs are `%AppData%\jira-cli` (config and queries)
    and `%LocalAppData%\cache\jira-cli` (cache). If you've already uninstalled
    the binary, remove the keyring or 1Password item by hand through the OS
    keychain app or `op item delete`.
