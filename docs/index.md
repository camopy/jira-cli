# jira-cli

Manage your Jira issues from the command line.

jira-cli brings Jira into your terminal: read and search issues, create and edit
them, move them through their workflow, and add comments, links, and
attachments, all without switching to the browser. Drop into a full-screen
dashboard to work a whole queue, or run a single command in a script. Both go
through the same commands.

Every command can also return a stable JSON envelope with typed exit codes, so a
script or an AI agent reads the result exactly as a person would. That makes
jira-cli as comfortable to automate as it is to drive by hand.

## First run

Install jira-cli ([all methods](installation.md)), then point it at your site and
make your first read:

```sh
jira config init --base-url https://example.atlassian.net --email you@example.com
jira auth login  # (1)!
jira issue list --assignee me
```

1.  Prompts for your API token and stores it (interactive on a TTY).

See [Authenticate](auth.md) for the 1Password backend and the headless (CI) flow.
