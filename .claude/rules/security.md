# Security

## Credentials: stored once, revealed never

*   Credentials live in the OS keyring, 1Password, or environment fallbacks
    — never in the config file, logs, envelopes, or test fixtures. Profiles
    are metadata-only by design (see [config.md](config.md)).
*   The `auth token` redaction boundary is deliberate (it prints redacted
    last-four diagnostics only): never add a code path, flag, or debug
    output that reveals a stored token. When an operation genuinely needs
    the credential (a raw API call, a new backend), it goes through the
    existing client/store layers — the token value never transits an
    envelope, a log line, or `argv`.
*   gosec `G101` scans identifiers matching
    `passwd|pass|…|token|api_key` with entropy checks — a hardcoded-looking
    secret fails CI (test paths exempt).

## Read-only is a transport property

Read-only mode blocks mutations at the HTTP transport
(`internal/jira/client.go`), resolved per-invocation by
`cmdutil.ReadOnlyEnabled` (`JIRA_READ_ONLY` env wins OFF→ON only; on
config-load failure it fails *writable* so the real error surfaces instead
of a masking refusal). Keep enforcement at that layer — never add a code
path that routes a write around the transport, and never key the decision
off anything but the shared resolver.

## Jira content is untrusted input

Everything Jira returns (summaries, descriptions, comments, field values,
even completion candidates) is third-party text:

*   Route it through the terminal sanitizer before it reaches a terminal —
    completion candidates already are (tab/newline injection); every new
    output path must be too.
*   Never feed Jira-sourced strings into shell commands, file paths, or
    format strings unvalidated.

## Exec and path discipline

*   `exec.Command` with argument slices only — never a concatenated shell
    string. `x/shell.Quote`/`Split` implement POSIX display semantics; they
    are **not** an injection defense.
*   Scope untrusted file paths (attachment names, editor temp files) before
    writing; never join them into a parent directory unchecked. gosec
    `G306` sets the permission bar at `0750`;
    the reviewed `G304` exemption list (stdin, editor roundtrip, cache,
    docs gen, loaders) grows only with the same review.
*   Browser opens go through `internal/browser` (reviewed `gosec` nolints
    live there) — don't open URLs from anywhere else.

## Enforcement is layered, not a redaction filter

There is no output-scrubbing utility, and you should not assume one:
protection comes from boundaries — profiles hold no secrets, stores never
print, envelopes are built from typed data via `cli.WriteEnvelope`, and
depguard/ruleguard ban the escape hatches (`log`, raw pflag, unwrapped
calls — [style.md](style.md)). Treat any secret appearing in a printed
string, envelope field, or command argument as a bug, not a filtering gap.

## Supply chain

GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned and zizmor-audited (pedantic); releases are
GoReleaser-built and cosign-signed; gosec + govulncheck run in `mise run ci`
and the hk pre-commit hooks. A new dependency needs justification —
gechr-first (see [go.md](go.md)).

The `security` task runs govulncheck through `cmd/check-vuln`, not bare:
govulncheck has no native allowlist, and `-format json` never sets a non-zero
exit, so `check-vuln` parses the stream, treats a symbol-level finding (a
function in `trace[0]` — package `init` counts) as affecting the build, and
owns the exit code. It carries one reviewed allowlist (`allowed`), each entry
an advisory ID plus the reason it is safe to ship. Add an ID there **only**
with a written reason after judging reachability — the first resort is always
to fix the code or bump the dependency. The allowlist is rot-hostile: an entry
that stops firing (upstream fixed it, the DB withdrew it, the import went away)
fails the build until removed, the same discipline nolintlint enforces on
`//nolint`. `check-vuln` is itself the guardrail — there is no separate test.

## Gates

Destructive commands require `--force`; headless mutations require
`--no-input`. Do not weaken either gate, and do not add a bypass "for
agents" — the gates exist *because* of agents.
